Hi, Gracey

I am writing to consult about the application for the Kinesiology (PhD) Program in 2026. My name is Mengxing Li.  I came from China and graduated from the University Canada West with an MBA in July 2024.  When I check the application guide on the Uvic website, I have several questions in mind:

1. Since my MBA background, I want to confirm if I meet the application requirement, saying ‘Admission to the kinesiology PhD program also requires a master’s degree in kinesiology or a related field.’  And who is the person to tell if I meet this requirement?
2. I had a talk with Professor Ryan Rhodes this week, and he suggested that I could take some undergraduate kinesiology courses in preparation for the Ph.D. application.  My question here is whether the requirement in my first question is a hard condition or can be satisfied after I finish several undergraduate kinesiology courses.
3. About the recommendation for my admission from the potential supervisor

 According to the application guide, an email from the Professor with the application is required, showing the professor agrees to be my supervisor and recommends my admission. My question here is whether I need to get this recommendation email from the professor before I submit my application.
